# Crazy Cleaner & Spoofer Project

## 🚀 About This Project
Welcome to my **Crazy Project**! I'm creating simple but powerful tools for spoofing and cleaning. The goal? To stay **undetected** in games like:

- Fortnite
- Call of Duty (COD)
- Valorant
- Rainbow Six Siege
- ...and more!

## 🔑 Main Features

1. **Kernel Driver** for temporary spoofing.
2. **AMIDEWIN** method for permanent spoofing.
3. My **Crazy Cleaner** is 100% **undetected** for many games.
